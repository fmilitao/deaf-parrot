/* WELCOME!

 Dead-Parrot is a prototype implementation of our language written entirely
 in javascript and should run directly in a modern web-browser (Google Chrome
 preferred).

 Parsing and typechecking errors should be flagged on-the-fly.

 NOTES:
  - allows C-style comments.
  - the languages uses a few IDIOMS for convenience (see idioms example).
  - sharing support is still EXPERIMENTAL (i.e. work in progress).
