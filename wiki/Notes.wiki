#Prototype implementation notes.

= Implementation =

Prototype's design is focused on showing typing information and protocol uses/conformance.

Consequently, some additional type annotations are required, for instance on alternatives to avoid "retrying" on different alternative.

Notes:

 * Delta^G restrictions on environments still shows the defocus-guarantee (although it is not accessible) on the typing information panel. Just like framing still shows the types framed, the typing information does not omit the defocus-guarantee inside functions and foralls although they are actually NOT accessible from within (you get a type error). Not very user friendly...

 * To simplify the implementation and center it on RG protocols, the only way to introduce & types is with 'share'.

  * Prototype now uses recursive type definitions instead of standard rec types. Simplifies syntax and implementation.
